## Tron Bet Assist

Is a windows-based application that will help automate bets on the WINK platform. The app will allow your automated bets to become "smarter". For example, in the DICE game, it will bet higher amounts of TRX when it detects 2 or 3 consecutive losses (you choose 2 or 3).

For the time being, the features are minimal and is only made for DICE. But, If the tool gains more traction and higher usage, I will add more betting scenarios and perhaps other games. Such as auto-betting X amount of spins after gold is detected in RING.
